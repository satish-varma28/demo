      <!--  Values for border-style include solid, dashed, double, dotted, groove, ridge, inset, outset and none.-->
       
      <!--When this property has only one value specified, the same style is applied to all four sides.-->

      <!--When it has two values, the first value is applied to the top and bottom borders, and the second value is applied to the right and left borders:-->

      <!-- When it has three values, the first value is applied to the top border, the second value is applied to the right and left borders, and the third value is applied to the bottom border:-->
       
      <!-- When it has four values, the values are applied to top, right, bottom and left - in that order.-->

     <!-- The border-width property is used to specify the thickness of the borders.
      For specifying values, we can use the standard absolute or relative units or we can use values like thin, medium or thick. -->

      <!-- border color = When the border-color property is not explicitly set, the border inherits the value of the color property of the element. If the color property is also not specified, the default value for color, and consequently the border color, is black.-->
