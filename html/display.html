  <!--When working with different types of elements, we notice something interesting. Elements like the div and p always start on a new line, and stretch to completely fit in the available width. But elements like span and a do not create a new line and only take up as much space as needed.-->

   <!-- We can make elements like span, a and img behave like block-level elements by setting their display property to block-->

   Example 1: <span>Now span also starts on a new line</span><br>
Example 2: <p>Paragraph starts on a new line and occupies 100% width</p>
<a href="#">Link 1</a>
<a href="#">Link 2 in the next line</a>
