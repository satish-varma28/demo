  <!--When working with different types of elements, we notice something interesting. Elements like the div and p always start on a new line, and stretch to completely fit in the available width. But elements like span and a do not create a new line and only take up as much space as needed.-->

   <!-- We can make elements like span, a and img behave like block-level elements by setting their display property to block-->

   Example 1: <span>Now span also starts on a new line</span><br>
Example 2: <p>Paragraph starts on a new line and occupies 100% width</p>
<a href="#">Link 1</a>
<a href="#">Link 2 in the next line</a>
     
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <!-- Display inline-->

        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
          </ul>

          <!-- NOTE = For inline elements, we cannot specify width or height. Also, vertical margins do not have any effect-->

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <!-- Sometimes it's helpful to have elements display in the same line but also behave like block-level elements with specified height and width.
          This can be achieved with the display value of inline-block-->

          <span id="span1">You cannot see me</span>
          <span id="span2">You can see me</span>
