    <!-- Position Fixed-->
     <!-- When you set an element's position to fixed, the element stays at the same position even when you scroll away.
     The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element relative to the browser window itself-->
     <div id="parent">
        <div id="fixed"></div>
      </div>


      <!-- Position Sticky-->
       <!-- With position: sticky, an HTML element starts off in its regular position that has been defined in the code, just like other elements.
       However, when you scroll down, it will stick to a specific spot on the screen.
       As you can see in the above example, we have added position:sticky to the orange div.

       When we scroll down, it keeps moving up like any other normal element.

       But after a while, it stops moving up and behaves like an element fixed in its position until we scroll back up.-->

       <div id="div1"></div>
        <div id="sticky"></div>
