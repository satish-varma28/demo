    <!--By default, all the HTML elements appear on the web page one after another in the same order as specified in the HTML markup. We can change this with the help of the CSS position property. -->

    <!-- Position Relative-->
     <!-- The default value for the position property is static. It makes the elements follow the normal flow.

     When you set an element's position to relative, you can move the element to a new location.

     The top, right, bottom and left properties are used to note the distance of the new location from the original default location.-->
     <div id="div1">
        Static
      </div>
      <div id="div2">
        Relative, but not moved
      </div>
      <div id="div3">
        Relative & moved
      </div>

      <!-- The top and left properties wouldn't work if you remove the position property. These properties don't work with the static position elements. You can check this by removing the position property for div3. Also, try setting top,right, bottom and left properties to div2 to see what happens.-->

       <!-- When we set the offset top property of an element with position property set as relative, the element actually moves away from the top edge of the screen or the container element.
       That is because the element is pushed from the top towards bottom-->

       <div class="container">
        <div class="static">

      <!-- In the above code, we can see that the position of the element with class relative appears 50px away from the top edge. This is because we have added the position property as relative with top offset of 50px to the element with class relative.-->


      <!-- IMPORTANT NOTE = Difference between offsets and margins.
      The top and left properties appear to work similar to the margin-top and the margin-left properties. But there is a big difference between them.

     When you set the top property of a relative element to 50px, only that element is shifted by 50px from the top. But if you set the margin-top property to 50px, all the elements below this particular element are also shifted down by 50px.-->

      The element with a lower z-index value goes behind the one with a higher z-index-->

     This element will be placed relative to the closest ancestor with any other position value.-->
